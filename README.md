# Happy Thoughts

Project built in React using react state to fecth and post happy thought -messages to an Api.

## The problem

I started the project by planning the different components. I decided to have two components, one contained the post message section and one the  section where the messages where displayed. I then used the API for fetching and displaying the 20 latest messages, and for posting and displaying the new message. Since my API-fetches where done in App.js i ended up with quiet a lot of code there. If i had more time i would have broken that code out into a seperat component.
